# Overview
This repository hosts the matlab code that allows for an analysis of Viral Genomic Sequences that are provided by the GISAID organization.  It allows for the usage of the Discrete Fourier Transform Distance in terms of genomic signals, and also explores how well the Power Spectra of the genomic sequences allows for the clustering/classification of sequences on geographic location of submission.  The software hosted in this repository was designed using, and implemented using the MatLab2020a release.  It was initially run on a x64 Windows 10 Laptop (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.21 GHz) with 16.0 GB of RAM, with 6 cores. The code does use a parralell pool for computing the Jukes-Cantor Distances in the resampling portion of the code, which allows for substantial speedup of the computation, and allows scalability to larger devices if it is desired to run for larger samples. 

# Software Provided

## DFT-Distance Calculation Codes 
This repository provides a MatLab implementation of the technique for computing the DFT distances between multiple sequences of possible different lengths that was first discussed in *A measure of DNA sequence similarity by Fourier Transform with applications on hierarchical clustering* by **Changchuan Yina, Ying Chenb, Stephen S.-T. Yau** in the 2014 *Journal of Theoretical Biology 359* pages 18-28, and the following year (2015) refined and further examined in *An improved model for whole genome phylogenetic analysis by Fourier transform* by **Changchuan Yin, Stephen S.-T.Yau** also in the *Journal of Theoretical Biology 382* pages 99-110.
